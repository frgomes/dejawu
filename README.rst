*dejawu* is an exploratory tentative to provide Dojo Toolkit with ScalaJS


Quick guide for the impatient
=============================

::

    $ sbt update clean run
    $ firefox http://localhost:9000/purejs


Status
======

1. No ScalaJS code yet.
2. Some declarative Dojo code in Javascript for initial exploration of ideas.
3. Currently still defining minimum set of widgets to be provided via ScalaJS.


TODO List
=========

1. Add buttons, comboboxes and other very common widgets (to be defined)
2. Add a grid widget
3. Add support for forms
4. Replace hardcoded data by AMD/Deferred/Reactive (whatever it is called!)
5. Implement minimum requirements in ScalaJS (based on scalatags possibly?)
